# Oympics_EDA

This project is a simple exploratory data analysis project looking over the Olympics 120 year history. I performed various queries and created visualisations of the data to better understand the Olympic history and results.

The two datasets used for this project are attached in this repository and were downloaded from the Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results. Examples of more questions to analyse can be seen from looking at different submissions from this dataset

I first had to merge the two datasets together for better understanding what region each athlete were from. I explored the data for overall participation from each country; age distribution of athletes; gender distribution of athletes; analysis of female participation over time; analysis of gold medal athletes e.g. athletes that won gold medals over the age of 60; which countries had been most successful in the Olympics and analysis of height/weight of athletes shown in a scatterplot.

There are some more ideas to extend this project such as seeing the age distribution over time, the height and weight distribution over time for each gender (for this I can use a boxplot and pointplot in seaborn). I can also visualise the height and weight distribution for each sport after a sepcific year e.g. 1992. Another interesting question is the height and weight changes for specific sports over time in specific sports such as gymnastics and weightlifting
